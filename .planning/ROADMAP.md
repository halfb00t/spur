# Roadmap: spur

## Milestones

- ✅ **v0.1 Hardening** — Phases 1–6 (shipped 2026-09-25) — full detail in
  `milestones/v0.1-ROADMAP.md`, audit in `milestones/v0.1-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`
- ✅ **v0.2 Fit to Shaft** — Phases 7–12 (shipped 2026-10-01) — full detail in
  `milestones/v0.2-ROADMAP.md`, audit in `milestones/v0.2-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**

- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)
- Numbering continues across milestones — the next milestone starts at Phase 13.

<summary>✅ v0.1 Hardening (Phases 1–6) — SHIPPED 2026-09-25</summary>

- [x] Phase 1: v0 Baseline (Shipped) (no plans — built and verified directly against `make verify` before GSD)
- [x] Phase 2: CAD Off the Event Loop (5/5 plans) — completed 2026-09-24
- [x] Phase 3: Structured Logging at the Composition Boundary (3/3 plans) — completed 2026-09-24
- [x] Phase 4: Typed Derived-Dimensions Contract (3/3 plans) — completed 2026-09-24
- [x] Phase 5: CI Observed Green (6/6 plans) — completed 2026-09-25
- [x] Phase 6: Address tech debt: merge gate + solid cache (4/4 plans) — completed 2026-09-25 (added 2026-09-25 after the Phase 5 review and the first milestone audit)

Goals, success criteria and plan lists: `milestones/v0.1-ROADMAP.md`. Phase artifacts:

<summary>✅ v0.2 Fit to Shaft (Phases 7–12) — SHIPPED 2026-10-01</summary>

**Milestone Goal:** A generated gear mounts on a real shaft and prints light — new bore
profiles, body cutouts and a tooth-tip chamfer, all additive on the shipped spur pipeline,
with tooth measurements untouched.

- [x] Phase 7: Foundation — Generalized Edge Selection + Regression Fixture (2/2 plans) — completed 2026-09-26
- [x] Phase 8: Hex Bore (4/4 plans) — completed 2026-09-26
- [x] Phase 9: Keyway Bore (5/5 plans) — completed 2026-09-27
- [x] Phase 10: Tooth-Tip Chamfer (5/5 plans) — completed 2026-09-28
- [x] Phase 11: Body Cutouts (9/9 plans) — completed 2026-09-29
- [x] Phase 12: Composition Pass (9/9 plans) — completed 2026-09-30 (re-verified 2026-10-01 after the review fixes)

Goals, success criteria and plan lists: `milestones/v0.2-ROADMAP.md`. Phase artifacts:
`milestones/v0.2-phases/`. Decisions: L26–L31 in `docs/architecture/decision_log.md`.
Landed as PRs #7–#13 through `make pr.land`; the close is its own PR.

## Process Notes (carried forward)

- Phases run on `gsd/phase-NN-*` branches cut from `origin/main` and land only through
  `make pr.land PR=N` (L22/L25); `.planning/` rides the same PR as the code, never a
  separate planning-only commit. The milestone close is itself a PR.
- `make verify` (ruff, mypy `--strict`, import-linter, unfinished-work scan, pytest) is the
  gate for every phase, no exceptions (L13). It runs as the pre-commit hook (~3.5 min at
  907 tests); `gsd_run query commit`'s 30 s timeout cannot survive it — commit with plain
  `git commit` and let the hook finish.
- Every phase that adds a decision logs it as a new `Lxx` in
  `docs/architecture/decision_log.md`, append-only.
- New parameters default to off (L05); the pre-v0.2 regression fixture is the standing
  proof, re-run by every later phase.
