"""`make pr.land PR=N`: the sanctioned path onto `main` (D-05, L22).

Why this exists: PR #2 merged five minutes after `test (3.10)` failed on run
35993984796 -- nothing stopped a human or tool from clicking "merge" on a PR whose
checks were red or absent. The wall is a ruleset on `main` (D-12, supersedes D-06;
applied and read back in Plan 05-03): GitHub refuses to merge a head without green
required checks or behind `main`. This module is the sanctioned tool through that
wall, not the wall itself -- "a tool, not a wall" (docs/HOW_TO_DEVELOP.md section 8).

Which of its checks the ruleset duplicates, and why they stay anyway (flagged
assumption 8, 05-02-PLAN.md): the ruleset enforces `behind_by > 0` (its strict
up-to-date policy) and the required job set (its required status checks). This
module keeps both. Step 5 below waits for the squash commit's own run to *appear*,
not to finish, because the merged tree is the checked tree -- that claim is proven
here, not rested on a server setting outside git this module does not read. And
`required-jobs.txt` is held equal to `ci.yml` by a test in this repository, while
the ruleset's own copy of the required-check names is not in git. The checks only
this module can make at all: the PR is open and based on `main` (a PR to another
base sits outside the ruleset, and step 5's evidence only ever exists for `main`);
a clean working tree (the local follow-up switches branches); no GitHub Actions
skip token in the squash subject or body (after D-03 that text is `main`'s commit
message, and the leak happens after the wall); the run for the squash commit
appearing at all; and the local follow-up.

Steps, in order: (1) read and parse the PR, refuse on its state/base; (2) refuse a
dirty working tree; (3) `check_head` -- refuse a behind, run-less, unfinished or
non-green head, and refuse a skip token in the checked subject/body
(`message_refusals`); (4) squash-merge with the exact subject and body just
checked; (5) poll for a run on the squash commit (~60 s,
`POLL_ATTEMPTS * POLL_INTERVAL_S`) and print its URL; (6) the local follow-up --
switch to the PR's base, pull, delete the local branch only when its tip equals
the merged head.

Needs network and an authenticated `gh`. Runs only as `make pr.land`; never part
of `make verify` or `make check` (like `bench`, D-16).
