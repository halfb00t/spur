    because it fit in the queue. `flag_executor_shutting_down` (line 540) only cancels
    a future whose own `.cancel()` succeeds, which a RUNNING future's never does. With

    just in this test: `MAX_QUEUED_BUILDS` admits 4 builds and D-07 affinity can route
    all four to one hash slot. [VERIFIED empirically this session, both pre- and
    post-fix, 5 runs each, with `cancel_futures=True` temporarily restored on

    awaitable rather than raising it out of `gather` itself, so the assertions below
    observe it directly. See 260924-bv5-SUMMARY.md for the run transcript.] Requests 2,
