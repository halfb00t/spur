"""Shared fixtures for the whole suite.

Autouse root-logger reset (Phase 3): `records.configure()` installs a handler bound to
whatever `sys.stderr` was at construction time. Without this fixture, any test that
calls `configure()` directly, or drives the app's `lifespan()` (which also calls it),
would leave that handler -- and the stream object it captured -- installed on the root
logger for every test that runs afterwards, including tests with no interest in logging
at all. Snapshotting the handler list and level before each test and restoring them
after is also what lets each `configure()`-touching test in tests/test_records.py start
from a genuinely unconfigured root logger, rather than depending on test execution order.
